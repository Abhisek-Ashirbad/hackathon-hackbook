### Hacking with Microsoft Azure
#### What is Azure?
Microsoft Azure is a flexible, scalable, and full-featured cloud platform. If you can imagine it, you can build it on Azure, using the tools, languages and frameworks you're already familiar with. Python, JavaScript, Java, .NET - you can run them all on Azure.

Using Azure you can run serverless code using Azure Functions, host web applications and databases, take advantage of artificial intelligence (AI) through Cognitive Services, and create your own machine learning models through Azure Notebooks or powerful Data Science Virtual Machines (DSVM).

If you're new to Azure, we have a host of learning options available to you.
